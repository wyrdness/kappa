      "summary": "A Japanese water demon (yokai) described as turtle-like, human-sized creature with a beak, webbed hands and feet, and a distinctive bowl-like depression on its head that holds water. Kappa are dangerous, known for drowning people (especially children) and challenging them to sumo wrestling, but can be outwitted and love cucumbers.",
      "full": "The kappa (河童, 'river child') is one of the most famous yokai in Japanese folklore. Depicted as amphibious, turtle-like creatures roughly the size of a human child, kappa have several distinctive features: a bowl-like depression (sara) on top of their heads that holds water, a turtle-like shell on their backs, webbed hands and feet, and a beak-like mouth. The water in the head bowl is the source of their power—if it spills, the kappa becomes weak or dies. Kappa are primarily water dwellers, inhabiting rivers, ponds, and streams throughout Japan. They are known for being mischievous and dangerous, particularly to children, often drowning victims by pulling them underwater. However, kappa are also depicted as intelligent and honorable, loving cucumbers, respecting politeness, and keeping their promises. The kappa serves multiple cultural roles: a water safety warning for children, an explanation for drownings, and a beloved cultural icon appearing in modern media, mascots, and warning signs near water."
